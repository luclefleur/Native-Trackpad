</div>

- **Pan** - slide with two fingers
- **Zoom** - pinch with two fingers
- **Rotate** - shift + slide with two fingers
- **Zoom to Fit** - double tap with two fingers

## Be Aware

- In Fusion settings make sure to **turn off** `Use gesture-based view navigation`!  
  And restart the application.
- You can't no longer scroll in Data panel and other few places!  
  If you are stuck scrolling hold Command key!
- Perspective camera can be very slow in certain situations!  
  Orthographic camera fixes that!
