# Native Trackpad<br/>Add-In for Autodesk Fusion 360

</div>

- **Pan** - slide with two fingers
- **Zoom** - pinch with two fingers
- **Rotate** - shift + slide with two fingers
- **Zoom to Fit** - double tap with two fingers

## Be Aware

- You can't no longer scroll in Data panel and other few places!  
  If you are stuck scrolling hold Command key!
- Perspective camera can be very slow in certain situations!  
  Orthographic camera fixes that!

## Install

- [Download](https://github.com/luclefleur/Native-Trackpad/releases/download/0.14/NativeTrackpad.zip).
- Unzip.
- Go to: Tools → Add-ins → Add-ins → Click ➕.
- Select unzipped folder.
- In Fusion make sure to turn on `Use gesture-based view navigation` (which is the default).

There is no special needs to configure your Trackpad in System Preferences.
What I personally do is set Tracking speed to maximum to have panning even faster.
